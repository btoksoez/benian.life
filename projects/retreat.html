            <p>A few weeks ago, Sacha Ede and I hosted our first retreat. The intention was to create a space to look inside, connect with one’s emotions, and become present. It really felt like it came together on its own, and in the end, we had 8 participants, a cook, a musician, and had 5 beautiful and intense days together.</p>
            <p>I had some self-doubts beforehand because, although I have attended multiple seminars and retreats, I don’t have any ‘formal’ education in this field. But during these days, I realized that the most important qualities a spaceholder can bring to create a safe space for people to engage in emotional processes, address old wounds, and express themselves are presence, curiosity, and authenticity.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, I really felt a high from bringing these meaningful experiences to people, and also from having found another thing I feel really excited about, next to programming and entrepreneurship. I also learned a lot about myself and gained confidence in my intuition to sense what’s needed and my ability to organize and run such events.</p>
            <p>I really believe that the world needs more of these kinds of spaces, where people (especially men!) can drop their masks, feel their emotions, and be present without distractions (while also having fun!!).</p>
            <p>That’s why I’m excited to be hosting these more regularly in the future. If you’re interested in participating one day, you can drop me a message.</p>
